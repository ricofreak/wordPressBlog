I wish to convey special thanks to my wife: Nóra and friends: János and Áron who tested my themes many times. They gave me so many feedback on my work and helped me to improve Manduca. 
I have to express my appreciation to Blair in Cameroon, who reviewed my theme so many times,  and contributed to form a messy theme to a professional one.
